Its declarative nature and massive ecosystem mean students can find a library for almost any feature they want to build. Next.js builds on React by offering server-side rendering and static site generation, making it the go-to for production-grade applications that need excellent SEO.\n\nAt Brandex, we emphasize mastering vanilla JavaScript before jumping into frameworks. However, once the fundamentals are solid, frameworks like Vite drastically speed up the development process by providing instant hot module replacement (HMR).

Tools like Nmap allow you to scan target networks for open ports and vulnerable services. Once you have a map of the network, you can begin inspecting traffic using Wireshark to find unencrypted credentials or hidden API endpoints.\n\nWeb exploitation is another massive category. Learning how to intercept HTTP requests using Burp Suite is critical for finding SQL injections and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

They don\'t "think" in the human sense; they predict the most mathematically probable next word in a sequence based on billions of parameters of training data. Understanding this architecture is crucial for learning how to effectively prompt these models and constrain their outputs to avoid hallucinations.\n\nWe teach students how to interact with APIs and build their own autonomous agents using open-source models.
